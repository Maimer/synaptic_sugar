#SYNAPTIC SUGAR

Created by Nicholas Lee

This game is currently unfinished in its current form.  It allows for true "space" physics in that it allows for conservation of momentum in movement as well as 100% elastic "mass based" collisions between asteroids as well as slightly less than 100% elastic collisions between the spacecraft and asteroids.

You can currently destroy asteroids by firing your weapon and there is a total score count as well as a current speed indicator.  There is a health bar that reflects damage taken from hitting asteroids.  Damage is proportional to the speed of the collision and the mass of the asteroid that was impacted.
